                <h3>Early years (1902-1943)</h3><hr>
                <div><img src="./realhistory.jpg" alt="Old Photos of Real" class="textimg"></div>
                <p><strong>Santiago</strong> Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943. Under his presidency,
                the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the
                club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Estadio Santiago
                Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former
                Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera,"
                known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing 
                world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>In 1955</strong>, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor 
                of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament
                for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League. It 
                was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish
                and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960,
                which included the 7-3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five 
                consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear 
                the UEFA badge of honor. Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented 
                domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953-54 
                to 1968-69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961-65, and finishing runners-up a further three 
                times.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>The club</strong> won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2-1 
                in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.
                This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name "Yé-yé" came from the "Yeah, yeah, yeah" chorus 
                in The Beatles' song "She Loves You" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated 
                the Beatles. The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962 and 1964. In 
                the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups. The club competed 
                in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970-71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it 
                lost to English side Chelsea 2-1 in a replay. On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu 
                died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honor 
                him during the tournament. The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo 
                Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>Bernabéu</strong> had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won 1 
                Intercontinental Cup, 6 European Cups, 16 league titles, 6 Spanish Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Copa 
                Eva Duarte.

                <h2>Records and statistics</h2><hr>

                <div><img src="./realstats.jpg" alt="Raul statistics" class="textimg"></div>
                <p>
                Raúl holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 
                1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having
                 played 710 times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances.
                  With 189 caps, Cristiano Ronaldo is Real's most capped international player. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos
                   has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.</p>
                   
                <p>
                Cristiano Ronaldo (2009-2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.
                 Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953-1964),
                 Santillana (1971-1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958-1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985-1992), Karim Benzema 
                 (2009-present) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994-2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also 
                 holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014-15), alongside being 
                 Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 
                 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by 
                 Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The 
                 fastest goal in the history of the club (12 seconds) was scored by the Brazilian Ronaldo on 3 December
                 2003 during a league match against Atlético Madrid. </p>
                 
                <p>
                Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a 
                Copa del Rey match in 2006. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 81,044. 
                The club's average attendance in the 2007-08 season was 76,234, the highest in European leagues.
                 Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (35 as of 2021-22)
                  and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960-65 and 1985-90). With 121 matches 
                  (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home 
                  in La Liga.[206] </p>
                
                  <p>
                The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fourteen times
                 and for the most semi-finals appearances (31). As of October 2022, Cristiano Ronaldo is the 
                all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total,
                 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in 
                 the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955-56 to 1969-70. Among
                  the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014-15 
                  season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide. The same season, the team tied the record winning
                   streak in the Champions League, with ten games. In September 2017, the club equalled the 
                   record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game.</p>
                   
                   <p>
                In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history 
                of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million). 
                The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus 
                to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling)
                 had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan
                  for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly
                   a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million. In 
                   January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record
                    transfer fee of €100,759,418. Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the 
                    club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million. The club's record sale 
                    occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.

                <h2>Rivalries</h2>
                <h3>El Clásico</h3><hr>

                <div><img src="./elclasico.jpg" alt="El Clasico" class="textimg"></div>
                <p>There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is 
                    particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as 
                    "The Classic" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as 
                    representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities.
                     The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the 
                     Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. 
                     Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories
                    for Barcelona, and 52 draws.</p>
                    
                <p>As early as the 1930s, Barcelona "had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed
                     to the centralising tendencies of Madrid". During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de 
                     Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were 
                     frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to 
                     Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than 
                     a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.
                </p>

                <p>There's an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939-75) influenced the activities and 
                    on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths 
                    favouring their narratives. Most historians agree than Franco did not have a preferred football team, but 
                    his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético
                     Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its royal name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real
                      Madrid CF). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed CF Barcelona succeed as "Spanish team" rather 
                      than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid weren't particularly successful,
                       winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, 
                       one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed 
                       to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid'
                       s 11-1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged 
                       intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid despite his agreement
                        with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's "revolution"
                         that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who
                          fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top not only of Spanish but also European football, 
                          helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision
                           was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles but also swept the
                            first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s. These events had a profound impact on 
                            Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he 
                            realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became
                             his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign
                              Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that "Real Madrid is the best embassy we have
                               ever had". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under 
                               his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, 6 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 1 Copa 
                               Eva Duarte, 6 European Cups, 2 Latin Cups and 1 Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, 
                               Barcelona had won 8 league titles, 9 Copa del Generalísimo titles, 3 Copa Eva Duarte titles,
                                3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and 2 Latin Cups.</p>
               
                <p>
                The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano.
                 Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogotá,
                  Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia,
                   Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team 
                   to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian
                    lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish 
                    rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football
                     Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953-54 and 1955-56 seasons in
                      Madrid, and the 1954-55 and 1956-57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the 
                      Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision 
                      created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in
                       September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, 
                       signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3
                        million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary
                         for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual 
                         revenue of the Madrid club.<br>
                      
                Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his 
                first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup. 
                The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the 
                European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959-60 and Barcelona
                 prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960-61. Ahead of the 1973-74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived 
                 to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax. Already an established player with Ajax, 
                 Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona 
                 over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further 
                 endeared himself when he named his son "Jordi", after the local Catalan Saint George. In 2002, 
                 the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the "Match of The Century" by Spanish media, and 
                 Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world. A fixture known for 
                 its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, 
                 often involving mocking the opposition. In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000
                  Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as 
                  if telling the crowd to be quiet. In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan
                   armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu. Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile
                    crowd to "calm down" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016. In April
                     2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by
                      taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans - with his name and 
                      number facing them. Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of 
                      the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before 
                      holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.

            <h3>El Derbi madrileño</h3><hr>
            <div><img src="./madrileno.jpg" alt="Old Photos of Real" class="textimg"></div>
            <p>The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football 
                teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident
                 members of Madrid FC. The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional 
                 championship, with Real Madrid winning 2-1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929
                  in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first 
                  official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2-1. After the Civil War, during the early 
                  Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético
                   Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In 
                   any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the 
                   historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the
                    1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup 
                    titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, "Real Madrid are 
                    the best ambassadors we've ever had. "Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were 
                    "El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país" - "The team of the government, the shame of the
                     country" - and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture,
                      and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the "true" leftist club in Madrid).</p>
                     
            <p>The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met 
                in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1-0 at the 
                Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2-1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when
                , led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa 
                del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961. In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most 
                successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético
                 calling them and their supporters "Indios" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed
                  by the Red-and-whites). It is worth noting that by then, Real Madrid was not very keen on signing
                   non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese
                    star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, "Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco 
                    con bigote" ("As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here"). Atlético's
                     supporters accepted the new "Indian" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The 
                     Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class 
                     Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used 
                     until the 2016-17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a 
                     motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater 
                     resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the 
                     south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city. In fact, the 
                     Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference 
                     to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region).</p>
                     
            <p>Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, 
                winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat 
                Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very
                 favorable. A high point came in the 2002-03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a
                  4-0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the
                   Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013-14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions 
                   League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4-1 
                   comeback victory in extra time. On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14
                   years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4-0 loss. On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for 
                   the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.

            <h3>El Viejo Clásico</h3><hr>
            <p>A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico
                 (the old classic), so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century,
                  meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903. Until 10 December 2011, 
                  this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El 
                  Clásico.</p>
                
            <p>Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players, have long since ceased to be a 
                competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions have 
                collected no major trophies since 1984 and won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005-06
                 to 2016-17. However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and 
                 cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry 
                 as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.
